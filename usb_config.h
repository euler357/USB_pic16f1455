 File Description:

 Change History:
  Rev   Date         Description
  2.8   8 Oct 2010   Added definitions for supporting new 
                     USB_ENABLE_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUTS feature.
                     Changed the CDC comm EP and data EP from 2,3
                     (respectively) to 1,2 respectively, so as to
                     save RAM.

//Option to enable auto-arming of the status stage of control transfers, if no
//"progress" has been made for the USB_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUT value.
//If progress is made (any successful transactions completing on EP0 IN or OUT)
//the timeout counter gets reset to the USB_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUT value.
//
//During normal control transfer processing, the USB stack or the application 
//firmware will call USBCtrlEPAllowStatusStage() as soon as the firmware is finished
//processing the control transfer.  Therefore, the status stage completes as 
//quickly as is physically possible.  The USB_ENABLE_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUTS 
//feature, and the USB_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUT value are only relevant, when:
//1.  The application uses the USBDeferStatusStage() API function, but never calls
//      USBCtrlEPAllowStatusStage().  Or:
//2.  The application uses host to device (OUT) control transfers with data stage,
//      and some abnormal error occurs, where the host might try to abort the control
//      transfer, before it has sent all of the data it claimed it was going to send.
//
//If the application firmware never uses the USBDeferStatusStage() API function,
//and it never uses host to device control transfers with data stage, then
//it is not required to enable the USB_ENABLE_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUTS feature.

#define USB_ENABLE_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUTS    //Comment this out to disable this feature.

//Section 9.2.6 of the USB 2.0 specifications indicate that:
//1.  Control transfers with no data stage: Status stage must complete within 
//      50ms of the start of the control transfer.
//2.  Control transfers with (IN) data stage: Status stage must complete within 
//      50ms of sending the last IN data packet in fullfilment of the data stage.
//3.  Control transfers with (OUT) data stage: No specific status stage timing
//      requirement.  However, the total time of the entire control transfer (ex:
//      including the OUT data stage and IN status stage) must not exceed 5 seconds.
//
//Therefore, if the USB_ENABLE_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUTS feature is used, it is suggested
//to set the USB_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUT value to timeout in less than 50ms.  If the
//USB_ENABLE_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUTS feature is not enabled, then the USB_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUT
//parameter is not relevant.

#define USB_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUT     (BYTE)45   //Approximate timeout in milliseconds, except when
                                                //USB_POLLING mode is used, and USBDeviceTasks() is called at < 1kHz
                                                //In this special case, the timeout becomes approximately:
//Timeout(in milliseconds) = ((1000 * (USB_STATUS_STAGE_TIMEOUT - 1)) / (USBDeviceTasks() polling frequency in Hz))
